<h1>Azure Data Engineering</h1>

This repository contains all my hands-on exercises, notes, code, notebooks, and outputs as I learn and practice Azure Data Engineering for 30 days.

## 🗓️ Day-wise Progress

Day | Topic | Status
--- | --- | ---
Day 1 | ETL vs ELT | ✅ Completed
Day 2 | ETL Hands-on (Google Colab) | ✅ Completed
Day 3 | Batch vs Stream Processing | ✅ Completed
Day 4 | Data Lake vs Warehouse vs Lakehouse | ⏳ Coming

I am documenting everything I learn each day — with code examples, Google Colab notebooks, theory notes, visuals, and output files.

## 🚀 Day 1 – ETL vs ELT Fundamentals

## 🚀 Day 2 – ETL Hands-On Using Google Colab

### Topics Covered

✔ Loaded CSV directly from GitHub (raw link)
✔ Performed transformations using Pandas
✔ Renamed columns
✔ Filtered rows
✔ Added new calculated fields
✔ Saved processed CSV
✔ Downloaded output

Code Used
import pandas as pd

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/tips.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

**1. Rename column**

df = df.rename(columns={"total_bill": "bill_amount"})

**2. Filter rows**

df_filtered = df[df["bill_amount"] > 20]

**3. Add new column**

df_filtered["tip_percent"] = (df_filtered["tip"] / df_filtered["bill_amount"]) * 100

**Save output**

df_filtered.to_csv("processed_tips.csv", index=False)

### Deliverables

📂 day-02-etl-practical/
Contains:

Google Colab notebook (etl_colab_notebook.ipynb)

Output file (processed_tips.csv)

Notes file (day2-notes.md)

## 🚀 Day 3 – Batch Processing vs Stream Processing

- Stream Processing
- Differences between Batch and Streaming
- Real-world examples

### Deliverables
